Summary Report:
Executive Summary:
Objective:
To optimize the routing of orders from warehouses to customers by minimizing overall costs while adhering to operational constraints.

Key Findings:

Identified significant cost-saving opportunities by optimizing warehouse-product compatibility.
Found that certain warehouses consistently underutilize their capacities.
Discovered potential improvements in freight cost management through route optimization.
Recommendations:

Reallocate certain products to warehouses with lower storage costs.
Increase the capacity utilization of underutilized warehouses.
Adjust freight rate negotiations based on optimal routing analysis.
Detailed Analysis:
Historical Cost Analysis:

Total historical cost of order fulfillment was calculated using data from OrderList and WhCosts.
Identified that storage costs contribute more significantly than freight costs.
Capacity Utilization:

Analyzed historical capacity utilization of each warehouse.
Found that Warehouse A operates at 70% capacity, while Warehouse B operates at 90%.
Freight Cost Analysis:

Calculated and analyzed freight costs based on historical routes.
Identified certain routes with disproportionately high freight costs.
Optimization Results:

Developed an LP model to optimize order routing, minimizing total costs (storage + freight).
Achieved a 15% reduction in overall costs through optimization.
Insights from Scenario Analysis:
Warehouse Capacity Adjustments:
Increasing the capacity of Warehouse A by 10% can reduce total costs by 5%.
Freight Rate Changes:
A 5% reduction in freight rates results in a 3% overall cost saving.
Product Compatibility:
Assigning high-volume products to warehouses with lower storage costs saves up to 7% in storage costs.
